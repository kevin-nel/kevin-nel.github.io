<!-- Here are some articles that I have read that have helped me to stay productive or changed my way of thinking/doing thing. -->
<p>Here is a summary of an interesting productivity article that I found on BotB (a chiptune beat battle website) that has a focus on being more productive for creative tasks like making music.</p>
<h2 id="maximising-artistic-productivity---botb"><a href="https://battleofthebits.org/lyceum/View/Maximizing+Artistic+Productivity/">Maximising Artistic Productivity - BotB</a></h2>
<p>It's quite a long read so I have summarised it below.</p>
<ul>
<li>Failures occur more often than successes so setting yourself up for success by preparing beforehand and having a vision or goal for your project is key to being productive as an artist.</li>
<li>When dealing with failure it is also important to stay positive and not shift your arts failure over to yourself. A bad song does not make a bad songwriter. Instead of "this song is bad, i am bad" say "this song is bad but next time it will be better"</li>
<li>Keeping to a strict schedule (daily not weekly) and working beyond your plans when able is vital to being able to make up for bad days and still accomplishing what you set out to do.</li>
<li>When you lack inspiration and are having a bit of writers block the best thing to do is do all the busy work that wouldn't have taken any real inspiration to do like tweak automation, mixing, editing, etc.</li>
<li>Inspiration is also not just a magic feeling that comes and goes as it pleases, you can coax inspiration by exposing yourself to more art. This doesn't have to be art within your field, anything helps be it movies, photos, paintings, songs, books, poems, etc. The author puts it quite nicely</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>"Art is the food of which you must eat to produce your own art."</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>When it comes to large/long term projects splitting it up into small achievable tasks and forgetting about the big picture entirely can help to prevent the feeling of being overwhelmed.</li>
<li>Perfection is a killer of productivity, but it still has a purpose. On the one hand, an artist is almost never happy/proud of their prior work so chasing perfection can be a waste of time. On the other hand, perfectionism can still increase the quality of your art, and it is important to have pride in your work and be passionate about it. so "don't sacrifice productivity for an unachievable ideal" is a good way to think about it.</li>
<li>Sometimes things that may seem like a distraction are actually helping. Analyse your surroundings and decide what is really helping and what is hurting your productivity.</li>
<li>Staying healthy is also important to give yourself every possible chance at success.</li>
<li>Your environment plays a factor as well. It doesn't necessarily need to be "clean" but it does need to feel inviting.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>"If you find your work space isn’t inviting, it won’t be aiding your productivity."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If you have read through my summary then you should definitely read the <a href="https://battleofthebits.org/lyceum/View/Maximizing+Artistic+Productivity/">original artical</a> in its entirety.</p>
