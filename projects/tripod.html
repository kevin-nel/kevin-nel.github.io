<p>My tripod was in a really sad state. The part that holds the phone was broken as well as the ring that holds the legs in place. As my first practical project utilizing <a href="/knowledge/3d-printing.html">3d printing</a> I took it upon myself to fix it.</p>

<p>I designed a replacement piece in freecad and printed a new phone mount.</p>

<p>I'm glad that I'm able to give new life to something I would've had to throw away were it not for <a href="/knowledge/3d-printing.html">3d printing</a></p>

<p>It's still kinda broken but i should be able to repair that as well, and my quick fix of tape and a splint seems to be holding up for now.</p>
