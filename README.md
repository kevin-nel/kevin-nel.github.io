# README

This is my personal site/wiki.
It is generated using [a short bash + pandoc script](https://github.com/kevin-nel/pandoc-ssg) that turns a folder of markdown files into a website with common header and footer.

my old jekyll site has been archived [over here](https://github.com/kevin-nel/jekyll-site-template)
