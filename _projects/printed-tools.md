## 1/4" bit driver

I printed from [this model](https://www.prusaprinters.org/prints/21710-hex-bit-driver-stand-with-latch) over on prusa prints.

It fits a standard 1/4" hex bit and allows me to use this bit set, initially inteded for drills as a screw driver.

It has a small clip on the inside of the hole that makes a slightly tighter fit, though it is still a little loose but not loose enough to fall out. If i printed it again I would scale it down to 99 or 98% of the original size or a small hole on the side for a set screw.
