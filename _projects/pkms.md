This is my attempt at setting up a personal knowledge management system (pkms) that can also aid me in writing blog posts.

Currently I am using vscode with the ["Markdown Notes" extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=kortina.vscode-markdown-notes).
I want to try and make my system easily transferrable to [vimwiki](https://vimwiki.github.io/) for my inevitable fulltime switch to [linux](/knowledge/linux.md)
