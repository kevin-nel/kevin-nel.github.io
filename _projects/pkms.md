> edit: I am now attempting to use [commonplacing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commonplace_book) on paper as I struggle to consistently maintain a digital version of all this and find the process of writing down the information to be beneficial to my absorbtion of it. I do still use these techniques inside of vscode for documentation of projects and for my final year engineering project.

This is my attempt at setting up a personal knowledge management system (pkms) that can also aid me in writing blog posts.

Some links:

- [suping up vs code as a markdown notebook](https://kortina.nyc/essays/suping-up-vs-code-as-a-markdown-notebook/)
- [excellent blog on second brain stuff](https://www.mentalnodes.com/mind-networks-modelling)
- Very useful article on [bullet journalling and your MBTI](https://blog.gouletpens.com/2019/01/mbti-bujo-4-ways-to-improve-your-note-taking-strategy/) (although the accuracy and usefullness of the MBTI personallity types is disputed the article is still helpful)

Currently I am using vscode with the ["Markdown Notes" extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=kortina.vscode-markdown-notes).
