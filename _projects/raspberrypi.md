Things to do with a raspberry pi (when I finally get one)

## music

- [monome](https://monome.org/) has some excellent open source gear that can be adapted to work on raspberry pi.
- [Norns on raspberry pi](https://github.com/FigrHed/Norns-on-Raspberry-pi)
- [mod duo emulator](https://blokas.io/modep/) run lv2 plugins in a modular style environment as a live effects processor and synth

## radio

[PiFmRds](https://github.com/ChristopheJacquet/PiFmRds)

## cyberdeck

### inspiration

[back7.co](https://back7.co)

[cyberdeck.cafe blog](https://cyberdeck.cafe/post/deck-builders-competition)

### features

These are some things I would want in a cyberdeck.

- [software defined radio](/knowledge/radio.md) (see [this radio cyberdeck](https://hackaday.io/project/174301-raspberry-pi-sdr-cyberdeck))
- mechanical keyboard
- LCD screen
- oled stat display
- battery (with charging)
- ergonomic shape for actual use (too many cyberdecks focus solely on a hacker grungy aesthetic and it looks dificult to use. I have found that reducing friction through good user experience/interface design can make something a lot more useful)
- midi sequencing via a tracker [like schism](http://schismtracker.org/) or something like [orca](https://100r.co/site/orca.html) (see: [how to use midi out in impulse tracker/schism](https://github.com/schismtracker/schismtracker/issues/185))
