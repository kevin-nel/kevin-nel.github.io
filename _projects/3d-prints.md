> The projects page is currently under construction. I mainly track progress of my larger projects using the README file in a github repository on [my gihub](https://github.com/kevin-nel?tab=repositories)

I have an ender 3 v2 and mostly print in PLA.

I am most comfortable using OnShape, as well as OpenSCAD (but I find it quite difficult to use for more complicated models).

## Tripod

My tripod was in a really sad state.
The part that holds the phone was broken as well as the ring that holds the legs in place.
As my first practical project utilizing [3d printing](/knowledge/3d-printing.md) I took it upon myself to fix it.

I designed a replacement piece in freecad and printed a new phone mount.

The phone mount model that I printed was [this model on thingiverse](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2423960).

I'm glad that I'm able to give new life to something I would've had to throw away were it not for [3d printing](/knowledge/3d-printing.md)

It's still kinda broken but i should be able to repair that as well, and my quick fix of tape and a splint seems to be holding up for now.
