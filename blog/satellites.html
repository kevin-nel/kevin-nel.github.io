<h1>how to receive weather images from the NOAA satelites using software defined radio
	(SDR)</h1>

<p>My experiences with amateur radio satellites.
	<!-- (this article is still in outline format) -->
</p>

<p>You can use the <a href="https://heavens-above.com/AmateurSats.aspx">heavens above site</a> or <a
		href="https://www.n2yo.com/">n2yo</a> to see what satellites are passing you and when.</p>

<p>Here is a collection of the satellite that I have decoded transmissions from.</p>

<h2>NOAA Weather Satellites</h2>

<p>The NOAAx satellites are weather satellites that broadcast a satellite image over VHF using the <a
		href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automatic_picture_transmission">APT (Autmatic Picture Transmission)
		protocol</a>
	They were commisioned by the <a href="https://www.noaa.gov/weather">National Oceanic and Atmospheric
		Administration</a></p>

<p>The two that often orbit over me are the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NOAA-15">NOAA-15</a> and the <a
		href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NOAA-19">NOAA-19</a>.</p>

<h3>Finding out when its passing</h3>

<p>for that you can use the <a href="https://heavens-above.com/AmateurSats.aspx">heavens above site</a> or the <a
		href="https://github.com/rt-bishop/Look4Sat">Look4Sat android app</a>.</p>

<p><img src="../img/heavens-above.png" alt="example view for the NOAA 19 satellite on heavens-above.com">
</p>

<p>The start and end times are when the satellite is passing and the altitude and azimuth are the angle and direction
	respectively.
	a 90Â° azimuth is directly over your head.
	you can use this information to help you orient yourself when you try to record the signal.</p>

<h3>recording the signal</h3>

<p>I used my baofeng uv5r to listen in on the frequency specified in the Look4Sat android app (137.62MHz in my case)</p>

<p>I recorded the audio using my cellphone. (I recorded a video but audio only would probably work better)</p>

<p>The longer and clearer recording you can get the better the final image will be.</p>

<p>I then stripped the audio from the video using ffmpeg</p>

<p><code>ffmpeg -i video.mp4 -c:v copy -vn audio.wav</code></p>

<h3>using wxtoimg</h3>

<p>If you are on windows you can use wxtoimg to decode your audio into a satellite image</p>

<p>wxtoimg is abandonware and getting hold of a copy can be a bit tricky with all the reposted copies available.
	I used <a href="https://www.wraase.de/wxtoimg/">this link</a> to get my installer.</p>

<p>The software is old enough that the windows version should work without issues in wine on linux but there is <a
		href="https://noaa-apt.mbernardi.com.ar/download.html">better software</a> available on linux.</p>

<p>The audio then needs to be mixed down to mono and resampled at 11025Hz to match the requirements for wxtoimg</p>

<p>the audio then needs to be saved as a .wav file.</p>

<p>This can be done using Audacity</p>

<blockquote>
	<p>note: if you have ffmpeg installed audacity may be able to automatically extract the audio from a video file
		on
		import</p>
</blockquote>

</p>

<p>the audio can then be imported into wxtoimg and it will be automatically processed into an image</p>

<h3>using noaa-apt</h3>

<p><a href="https://noaa-apt.mbernardi.com.ar/download.html">get noaa-apt here</a></p>

<h3>results</h3>

<p>My first attempt went quite poorly</p>

<p><img src="../img/noaa-first-attempt.png"
		alt="My first attempt at getting a sattelite image from one of the NOAA weather sattelites using my Baofeng uv5r">
</p>

<p>On my second attempt i was able to see some border informaiton and part of an image on the left</p>

<p><img src="../img/noaa-second-attempt.png"
		alt="My second attempt at getting a sattelite image from one of the NOAA weather sattelites using my Baofeng uv5r">
</p>

<p>but after giving it few more shots and taking a much longer recording I was able to decode a pretty decent image.</p>

<p><img src="../img/noaa-19-boafeng-best-false-color.png" alt="The best result I got from the baofeng (false color)">
</p>

<p><img src="../img/noaa-19-boafeng-best.png" alt="The best result I got from the baofeng (raw+IR)"></p>

<p>Here is a false color image and the raw+infrared image (you can make out some clouds as well as the west side of
	Africa)</p>

<p>The boafeng doesn't really have enough bandwidth to get a full
	quality image and it's really easy to accidentally move and mess up the signal (which you can see in the
	vertical
	lines)</p>

<p>I still haven't managed to get my SDR working for this.
	(I think i might need a different antenna) but it should provide much better image quality.</p>

<h3>tips</h3>

<ol>
	<li>try to get as long a recording as possible without too many interferences.</li>
	<li>recording the direct audio out from the headphone out into some kind of audio interface may provide cleaner
		recordings</li>
	<li>using a better <a href="radio.md#antennae">antenna</a> could also help</li>
</ol>

<p>I will be trying this again with an antenna and an SDR which should provide higher bandwidth (and thus more data) for
	a better quality image.</p>
