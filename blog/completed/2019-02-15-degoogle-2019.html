<p>the year was 2018, and the internet was filled with security concerns, data breaches and stories of social media sounding more like social engineering. It was also the year I decided to take control of my digital life, giving up facebook and instagram as well as switching up my search engine usage. It was the year I began to pay more attention to privacy online. In 2019 I took this a step further. this article is about my journey and is meant to serve as a guide for choosing services that value your privacy over those that don't.</p>
<h2 id="calendar">Calendar</h2>
<p>There was a time before all our calendars were synced and it was our own jobs to keep them updated. luckily this isn't a guide about stepping back in time as much as it is finding feasible alternatives to the services we use everyday. Most of my calendar usage has been tied into googles <em>E C O S Y S T E M</em> and I still haven't found a great non-cloud based alternative that works across all the platforms I need it to, but the best solutions so far is syncing up .ical or .csv files using syncthing, with another option being a calDav server.</p>
<h2 id="storage">Storage</h2>
<p>I am of the persuasion that</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"There is no cloud, only someone else's computer"</p>
</blockquote>
<p>so in my eyes the only cloud that should be worth your time is your own one. But that has proven to be more effort than desired for me, so I have settled with a combination of syncthing and dropbox for now (I may switch over to Mega after I have had look at the privacy policy)</p>
<h2 id="notes">Notes</h2>
<p>I have become a massive fan of markdown and pandoc over the last while (this very post was itself typed in markdown) and after having to use LaTex for a few varsity assignments I have come to conclusion that I dont need to use a wysiwyg for typesetting (or even slide shows) ever again. In order to sync stuff like todo lists I use syncthing and plain text files (with .md extensions mostly) since I can use KWGT (a really powerful custom widget app for android) to display the list on my home screen and refresh every couple of minutes, using a simple shellscript. I am thus able to edit the list on any of my devices and as long as im on the same network the list will get updated to my phone.</p>
<h2 id="operating-system">Operating System</h2>
<p>I switched to linux on my laptop for university but still use windows 10 at home.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>These are the three main things I chose to change although I still use gmail. towards the end of the year I started using instagram again and during my time off from social media in 2018 I discovered reddit which is my favourite website right now. I attempt to use these services with caution though but my journey with social media is a story for another day. There is also this amazing site for finding alternatives to common software and services, <a href="alternativeto.net">alternativeto</a>, which has filters for OS and allows you to only show open source options.</p>
