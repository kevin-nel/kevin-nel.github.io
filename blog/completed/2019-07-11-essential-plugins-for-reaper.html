<h1 class="title">Essential Plugins for Reaper</h1>
<p class="author">Kevin Nel</p>
</header>
<p>The first thing I realized when starting with <a href="https://reaper.fm">Reaper</a> was that I didn't have all the plugins I had before with logic pro and I was hunting down plugins for ages before I started really being productive. so here are my essential plugins for Reaper. <a href="#conclusion">TLDR at the end</a></p>
<h3 id="note">Note</h3>
<p>This is not a "top free plugins" list as there are plenty more free plugins that are amazing but I wouldn't consider essential to make reaper a complete DAW. If you've purchased better plugins like serum or sylenth1 etc, then you may not need all of these. This is a jumping off point intended to make Reaper a more usable environment for complete beginners or people coming from more production oriented DAWs looking to make electronic music.</p>
<!--
For a list of settings I suggest everyone change when first setting up Reaper, see [my blog post here.]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/music/reaper-settings.html)
-->
<h2 id="drums">Drums</h2>
<h3 id="sitala-drum-sampler"><a href="https://decomposer.de/sitala/">Sitala</a> Drum Sampler</h3>
<p>Firstly, unless you want to try figure out reasampleomatic5000 or you make ambient drone music you probably want a nice drum sampler. For that theres <a href="https://decomposer.de/sitala/">Sitala</a> an excellent free drum sampler that allows you to drag and drop samples, has multichannel outputs, gives your midi notes names in reaper, and gives you the ability to tweak the samples with a basic eq, reverse, fades and more! It also comes with an 808 and a 909 style kit.</p>

<h3 id="steven-slate-drums-5-free-acoustic-kit"><a href="https://stevenslatedrums.com/ssd5/#SSD5FREE">Steven Slate Drums 5 Free</a> Acoustic Kit</h3>
<p><a href="https://stevenslatedrums.com/ssd5/#SSD5FREE">Steven Slate Drums 5 Sampler</a> is the highest quality acoustic drum sounds you can get a hold of for free, the free kits it comes with can sound very heavy but the sounds are incredibly recorded and very velocity sensitive. You can tweak each drum sound individually, it supports multichannel outputs and the groove patterns that it comes with are pretty solid too.</p>

<h2 id="synths">Synths</h2>
<p>I am going to split this section up between a couple categories, and because I come from logic pro I am basically just finding replacements for what I was using in logic.</p>
<h2 id="modern-synthesizer-plugins">Modern Synthesizer Plugins</h2>
<p>These plugins are going to be your "workhorse" synthesizers. If you know your stuff you can make any sound using just these</p>
<h3 id="surge"><a href="https://surge-synthesizer.github.io/">Surge</a></h3>
<p>is an open source digital synthesizer with great presets and modulation options, it sounds great and can pull off anything from wavetables and fm to fat analog sounds.</p>
<figure>
<img src="/assets/images/reaper-essentials/surge.png" alt="surge" data-loading="lazy" /><figcaption>surge</figcaption>
</figure>
<h3 id="vital"><a href="https://vital.audio/">Vital</a></h3>
<p><a href="https://vital.audio/">Vital</a> is an excellent wavetable synthesizer in the vein of Arturia Pygments or Xfer Serum. Not to be over dramatic but this one is a game changer! It basically packs all the features of serum into a free (and open source) plugin. It is made by the same person who made helm which I suggested above. (I have completely switched from serum to Vital since it came out)</p>
<figure>

</figure>
<blockquote>
<p>Honorable Mention:</p>
<p><a href="https://tytel.org/helm/">helm</a> used to be on this list before Vital came out and it is still an excellent plugin. it is an open source synth thats nice for more complex and experimental sound design like dubstep or weird glitchy ambience. The modulation options are quite extensive and it is extremely versatile.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="retro-synths">"Retro" Synths</h2>
<p>If you're like me you probably love a good cheesy 80s pad or warm vintage mono lead synth. Here are my recommendations.</p>
<h3 id="discodsp-ob-xd"><a href="https://www.discodsp.com/obxd/">discoDSP OB-XD</a></h3>
<p><a href="https://www.discodsp.com/obxd/">discoDSP OB-XD</a> is an emulation of the classic Oberheim DX synthesizer. It is my go to for vintage polyphonic synth sounds. There are also a lot of preset banks available for it online.</p>
<figure>

<h3 id="tal-uno-62"><a href="https://tal-software.com/products/tal-u-no-62">Tal uno 62</a></h3>
<p><a href="https://tal-software.com/products/tal-u-no-62">Tal uno 62</a> is a great free emulation of a Roland Juno.</p>
<figure>

</figure>
<h3 id="uhe-tyrell-n6"><a href="https://u-he.com/products/tyrelln6/">Uhe Tyrell n6</a></h3>
<p><a href="https://u-he.com/products/tyrelln6/">Uhe Tyrell n6</a> is an analog style software synth with some cool presets and lots of functionality. The link on their website takes you to a german site, the download links are just a bit lower on the page.</p>
<figure>
<img src="/assets/images/reaper-essentials/tyrell.png" alt="tyrell" data-loading="lazy" /><figcaption>tyrell</figcaption>

<h2 id="fm-synths">FM synths</h2>
<p>FM synthesis can be pretty confusing, but if you give it time the sounds achievable can be incredibly rich and complex.</p>
<h3 id="dexed"><a href="https://asb2m10.github.io/dexed/">Dexed</a></h3>
<p><a href="https://asb2m10.github.io/dexed/">Dexed</a> is a one to one emulation of the yamaha dx7, it can even read old yamaha dx7 sysex presets. The interface is pretty confusing but since there are thousands of dx7 presets online you dont realy need to fiddle too much.</p>
<figure>
<img src="/assets/images/reaper-essentials/dexed.png" alt="dexed" data-loading="lazy" /><figcaption>dexed</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>If you are looking for something a bit easier to use/understand then <a href="https://www.sonicbits.com/exakt-lite.html">Sonic Bits Exakt Lite</a> is what you are looking for!</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.kvraudio.com/developer/dead-duck-software">dead duck ddx10 (download the instruments bundle)</a> could also be a viable alternative fo you if your just looking for something dead simple to get you going with some classic fm sounds.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If you don't already understand FM synthesis you can <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvBl3YUBUyY">check out this great video by Andrew Huang for a starter</a>, and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJrTk4cgFiQ">this one by the excellent cuckoo</a>.</p>

<h2 id="basslead-mono-synths">Bass/Lead (Mono) Synths</h2>
<p>What would a list of synthesizers be without some nice mono synths?</p>
<h3 id="tal-noise-maker"><a href="https://tal-software.com/products">Tal noise maker</a></h3>
<p><a href="https://tal-software.com/products">Tal noise maker</a> is another free Tal plugin (see any trends?) it's great for grimey basses, and its interface is much more refined than Tal elektro. Tal's filters just sound excellent and wonderfully dirty.</p>

<h3 id="hy-mono"><a href="https://hy-plugins.com/product/hy-mono/">HY mono</a></h3>
<p><a href="https://hy-plugins.com/product/hy-mono/">HY mono</a> is my current favorite mono synth vst. It's not too complicated, has a great interface and has just enough to get you fiddling and making some cool sounds.</p>

<h2 id="real-instruments">Real Instruments</h2>
<p>But what if you need an upright bass or trombone or maybe a harp?</p>
<h3 id="labs-spitfire-audio"><a href="https://www.spitfireaudio.com/labs">LAB's (Spitfire Audio)</a></h3>
<p>Spitfire Audio has been giving away sample libraries for free every couple of weeks in their <a href="https://www.spitfireaudio.com/labs">LABS plugin</a>. It has tons of cinematic and orchestral instruments as well as pads and other textural/experimental sounds. The "soft piano" preset has also become a modern classic. You really can't go wrong with these they sound very professional and it's easy to get great sounds out of them. They are also very responsive to midi velocity and thus can be very expressive. Also be sure to check their site every couple of weeks as they add more libraries all the time.</p>

<p><a href="https://vstplug-ins.com/keyzoneclassic.html">Keyzone Classic by Bit Sonic</a> has a much brighter grand piano type sound as opposed to the soft upright felt piano that comes with LABs. It also has a decent Rhodes-like electric piano.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.native-instruments.com/en/products/komplete/bundles/komplete-start/">Native Instruments Komplete Start</a> has pretty much everything else you could ask for. Their plugins are very high quality and this is just enough of a taste to make you crave the full version of Kontatk but the sounds that are available in this pack for free are very good.</p>

<h2 id="eq">EQ</h2>
<h3 id="reeq"><a href="https://forum.cockos.com/showthread.php?t=213501">ReEQ</a></h3>
<p>The stock eq plugin in reaper is great, but if you want to step up your EQ game you should try <a href="https://forum.cockos.com/showthread.php?t=213501">ReEQ</a> (not ReaEQ!). It is a JS plugin, but does not come with Reaper (you have to copy it into your <code>effects</code> folder in the Reaper resource path). This EQ has quite a few more types of bands as well as Mid/Side processing capabilities which ReaEQ (the stock EQ plugin) does not have.</p>

<h3 id="analog-obsessions-rare"><a href="https://www.patreon.com/analogobsession/posts">Analog Obsessions Rare</a></h3>
<p><a href="https://www.patreon.com/analogobsession/posts">Analog Obsessions Rare</a> is an excellent pulteq emulation. I am not normally one for preamps and analog emulsions of eqs but theres something really nice about Analog Obsession's plugins they add a little bit of drive in a very subtle and warm way. Certainly nicer than the white noise and distortion that some waves plugins add.</p>

<h3 id="analog-obsessions-brit-channel"><a href="https://www.patreon.com/analogobsession/posts">Analog Obsessions Brit Channel</a></h3>
<p><a href="https://www.patreon.com/analogobsession/posts">Analog Obsessions Brit Channel</a> aims to channel the sound of a neve 1073 channel strip. The drive is gain compensated which is amazing and it goes from adding some subtle warmth to full out blown capacitor sounds. the eq is also very nice and never sounds harsh even when pushing the highs up.</p>

<h3 id="analog-obsessions-merica"><a href="https://www.patreon.com/analogobsession/posts">Analog Obsessions Merica</a></h3>
<p><a href="https://www.patreon.com/analogobsession/posts">Analog Obsessions Merica</a> is another console emulator this time emulator a famous american channel strip. I love the way this sounds when boosting the highs and lows and cutting the mids it very smooth and held back so don't expect it to be as exaggerated as the brit channel but its still very useful for adding some subtle spice to a track.</p>

<h2 id="guitars">Guitars</h2>
<h3 id="lepou-amps"><a href="https://www.osirisguitar.com/lepou/">Lepou amps</a></h3>
<p>Don't let the age of the <a href="https://www.osirisguitar.com/lepou/">Lepou</a> amp modelling plugins fool you. They're a classic and for a reason. Most of the amps are a little too high gain for my taste but the hybrit is my favorite amp model. I even think it sounds better than the free guitar rig stuff.</p>

<p>Note:</p>
<p>These amp sims don't come with any cabinet emulation and the <strong>will</strong> sound like a box of nails if you don't use a cab sim, but do not fear because that's the next suggestion.</p>

<h2 id="reverbs">Reverbs</h2>
<p>Unfortunately when it comes to reverbs the free options are not quite as good as paid ones, I suggest your first plugin be a good reverb like Native Instruments Raum, or Valhalla Room. There are also plenty of reverb impulse responses available online that you can load into Reaverb or <a href="https://www.meldaproduction.com/MConvolutionEZ">MConvolutionEZ</a>. You can also wait for giveaways which most plugin companies do fairly often.</p>
<h3 id="tal-reverb-4"><a href="https://tal-software.com/products/tal-reverb-4">Tal reverb 4</a></h3>
<p><a href="https://tal-software.com/products/tal-reverb-4">Tal reverb 4</a> is an early 2000s styled digital plate reverb, you can get some crazy ambiance out of it, but don't expect anything too realistic.</p>

<p>Saving the best for last, <a href="https://www.musicalentropy.com/SpaceshipDelay.html">Spaceship Delay by Musical Entropy</a> is my all time favorite delay VST plugin! It does everything from pristine digital delay to gritty tape emulation with flutter and modulation. It is also very lightweight and versatile.</p>
