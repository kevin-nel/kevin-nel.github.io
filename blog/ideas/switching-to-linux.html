<h2 id="breakdown">breakdown</h2>
<ol type="1">
<li>reason : mac was unbearbly slow (after I replaced the hdd with an ssd)</li>
<li>partition was a mission</li>
<li>tried manjaro open box
<ul>
<li>had too many duplicate programs and wasnt as minimal as I thought</li>
<li>was extremely fast though</li>
<li>lots of small things needed to be configured for my 2012 macbook pro 13"</li>
</ul></li>
<li>installed linux mint xfce
<ul>
<li>first thoughts were that it looked 95% like cinnamon (the customization already done was great and the mint-y themes are great)</li>
<li>downloaded plank and moved the panel to the top</li>
<li>after a couple hours of use I (by instinct) pressed the keyboard backlight button and man was I surprised, it all worked</li>
<li>it did get very hot though and I hadn't notice the fans kick in, so after a bit of research I added <code>macfanctrld</code> to my startup programs and it was all perfect.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>window managers
<ul>
<li>xfwm4 was good enough for most stuff although I was using a tiling wm on osx (amethyst) and was missing the nice autoplacement of windows. I began to look for tiling functions in the window manager settings and that was when I discovered compiz</li>
<li>compiz is animation heaven and I was able to experience all the fancy smooth animations once again ( I had disabled all animations in OSX to try speed up the system)</li>
<li>wobbly windows</li>
<li>but I was missing the speediness of manjaro openbox,</li>
<li>so I tried xfce with open box but struggled geting a theme to match my mint-y-dark-grey setup</li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
<p>conclusion:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>linux has made using my macbook fun again and I no longer have to compromise because of speed, and most of my config files (for neovim and calcurse) worked out of the box</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="phase-2">phase 2</h2>
<ol type="1">
<li>I switched tro fedora for a linux challenge and itwas quite interesting</li>
<li>very minimal install with NO propreitary stuff</li>
<li>including my wifi driver so I had to find an ethernet cable and get my wifi working</li>
<li>after that fedora was perfect, the fans kicked in, keyboard brightness worked and there are touchpad gestures by default awesome!</li>
<li>gnome was a bit sluggish on my old macbook though so I decided to go back try plasma but it was too complicated for me</li>
<li>I then tried xfce again and it was great but again I was missing my window tiling</li>
<li>I had slowsly started to use more and more terminal applications in place of GUI stuff (largely becasue of performance but also because the stuff interested me)</li>
<li>I figured out hopw to get bspwm working inside xfce (this was great because I didnt have to fiddle wit setting up a panel and xfce ahs really nice power management out of the box.)</li>
<li>I then discovered the program Oomox and went crazy making my own themes and ricing my setup 9largely inspired by r/unixporn</li>
<li>all was not sunshine and roses though, there were a few programs I needed for university that didnt work and I was forced to use the abysmally slow lab PCs (i study electronic engineering)</li>
<li>then one of my classmates was also talking about linux and he said he did get it to work in pop!_os</li>
<li>I then went and install pop!_os and everything just worked and all the small stuff made so much sense that I didnt even feel like customizing or changing anything</li>
<li>gnome is also way more responsive on pop than on fedora and I hardly ever feel like im waiting for things to happen</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="phase-3">phase 3</h2>
<ol type="1">
<li>unfortunately my harddrive died</li>
<li>but I plan to replace it with an ssd in the holidays and try out a couple more distros in the holiday mainly elementary, vamilla ubuntu, manjaro, solus and possibly something more challengin like arch (which I most probably won't use next year for studies)</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="phase-4">phase 4</h2>
<ol type="1">
<li>unfortunately I still run windows 10 on my gaming pc at home because games are just less of a hassle to gety up and running on windows and I also really enjoy music production and have speent hundreds of hours learning reaper (after switching from logic pro on OSX which I had poured evne more hours into) and haven been able to get the linux version working as smoothly with vsts. maybe if they add a windows vst bridge (similar to the way reaper handles 32bit plugins) to make it more hassle free and I can figure out how to get my audio interfae working withough fiddling with pulse audio and jack.</li>
<li>main pont is that I enjoy fiddling with my computer but when I am making music I like there to be less in the way and having to fiddle with computer stuff definitely take me out of <em>the zone</em></li>
