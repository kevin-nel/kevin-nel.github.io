<h1 id="the-fediverse-and-other-alternative-social-media-sites">The Fediverse (and other alternative social media sites)</h1>
<h2 id="video">Video</h2>
<p>https://tube.privacytools.io</p>
<p>this is the official peertube instance of privacy tools.io it is mostly content from techlore and blender but there is a fair amount of it and it is better than accesssing the same content through youtube</p>
<p>https://vidcommons.org/</p>
<p>public domain and creative commons content</p>
<p>https://tilvids.com</p>
<p>tilvids is a peertube instance with a focus on edutainment content. while still undeniably a bit geeky and tech focused it stays away from political and extremist content that a lot of other federated platforms attract there is also (to my knowledge) no NSFW content. the environment and community is also relatively active with regards to comments and interactions, there is even a subreddit where the top video of the day is discussed.</p>
<p>odysee</p>
<p>odysee, although not entirely open source, is still worth checking out. it is an alternative frontend for LBRY (a blockchain based video streaming platform which has amassed quite a lot of support and content. a lot of youtubers that are worried about the future of youtube have begun to upload their videos to lbry (or odysee) as well there is also a crypto currency thing attached to it, just like every blockchain related thing. but you can get by fine without ever worrying about it</p>
<h2 id="microblogging-twitter">microblogging (twitter)</h2>
<p>koyu.space</p>
<p>a mastodon instance that is quite lighthearted and reminds me a lot of the old days of tumblr and twitter. you can of course still browser posts from other instances but the atmosphere of the community sets this instance apart.</p>
<p>mastodon instances</p>
<p>https://merveilles.town/about https://qoto.org https://mastodon.sdf.org forbidden e https://oulipo.social/about/more https://cybre.space/about https://shpposter.club/ https://mastodon.art/about/more very extensive blocklist and strict sounding policy regarding nsfw https://sunbeam.city/about solarpunk instance https://friend.camp closed</p>
<h2 id="link-aggregation">link aggregation</h2>
<p>lemmy</p>
<p>reddit alternative link aggregator for the fediverse</p>
<p>ruqqus</p>
<p>ruqqus is an alternative to reddit that has been attracting traffic lately due to reddit's mass banning and censorship. obviously the type of people that are attracted to these types of platform due to being banned from other platforms still exists, but there is a strong community of people that are excited to see ruqqus strive and find it's own place ruqqus still feels very fresh and although still touting free speech the user base manages to keep extremism at bay through civilised conversation some of the "guilds" (ruqqus' version of subreddits) have formed an "apolitical guilds union" to try and keep politics and extremism from taking over. from my experience using the platform it seems to be working, theres plenty of fun and interesting content from memes to cool articles and book reviews. some of the guilds can be quite light on discussion but there is a fair amount of community interaction considering the small userbase.</p>
