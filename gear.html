    <h3>2012 Macbook Pro</h3>
    <p>
        I have been using this machine since 2015.
        It was my first computer. I used it to start learning music production. I used it for university, and when MacOS
        wasn't working anymore; I put Linux on it, and I still use it to this day.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>The keyboard is great.</li>
        <li>It has almost all the ports I need (just missing an hdmi).</li>
        <li>It's easily repairable.</li>
        <li>I still get a good 4-6 hours of battery life out of it.</li>
        <li>And it's still good enough to use almost 10 years later (in 2021).</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Upgrades</h3>
    <p>
        I have since replaced the Hard disk with a 120Gb SSD and upgraded the ram from 4Gb to 8Gb. It may not seem like
        much, but those two upgrades alone turn this computer from frustration to a perfectly usable machine. It's no
        where near as powerful as my desktop pc, but it's more than enough to get some work done and browse the web and
        its extremely portable.

    <h3>chemex</h3>
    <figure><img src="img/chemex.jpg" alt="chemex">
        <figcaption>
            The Chemex is practically a work of art (it is even on display in the <a
                href="https://www.moma.org/collection/works/1847">Museum of Modern art in New
                York</a>).
            Something about its shape and form makes coffee just mesmerising to look at.
            On my recent trip to Europe I found one for a really good deal in a coffee shop in Paris, and decided to
            bring it home. It produces an extremely clean cup of coffee that is almost tea-like. The filters are much
            more expensive than the Hario V60 filters, so I am reserving it for special occasions. It is also the only
            brewer I own that is capable of making more than 2 cups of coffee at once, this makes it great for when I am
            making coffee for friends/family.

    <h3>aeropress</h3>
    <figure><img src="img/aeropress.png" alt="aeropress">
        <figcaption>
            I find the aeropress to be extremely forgiving and it is very difficult to mess it up and make a bad cup of
            coffee. This is important for me when I don't/can't use a scale and it also makes it a perfect candidate for
            my
            daily driver. I make coffee using my aeropress twice a day using James Hoffman's optimised recipe.

    <h2>Moka Pot</h2>

    <p>
        I don't use my moka pot very often, but I love to use it when I am in the mood for a milky beverage like a
        cappuccino or latte. When I make an improv cappucino I use my french press to froth some heated milk. Moka is
        different from espresso since it can't build up enough pressure so it's not a 1:1 but it gets close enough for
        me.
        I use James hoffmans recipe when I prepare moka.
    </p>
    <h3>French Press</h3>
    <p>
        This was my first foray into making real coffee at home. Up until this point I had been drinking instant coffee
        my entire life. I enjoyed it with pre-ground coffee for a while but soon started to look into getting a grinder
        to
        start using beans. I have yet to invest in a decent french press and I tend to avoid it due to the extra clean
        up when compared to
        v60 and aeropress. I still use it more often than the moka pot though and enjoy the richer body and more earthy
        flavours this method brings out due to its fairly large filter that allows more particulates into the cup.
    </p>
    <h2>Hario Hand Grinder</h2>
    <p>
        This was my first grinder and allowed my to start using beans and grinding fresh instead of using preground
        coffee. It's a lovely ceramic burr grinder with a curvy cylindrical design. It can hold enough grounds for 2-4
        cups of
        coffee and the vessel that holds the grounds allows the coffee to pour out freely since there aren't many
        crevises for the coffee to get stuck in (unlike my electric grinder which is a pain and makes a terrible mess.).
        It's a
        little bit of work to use and is not the most consistent for larger grind sizes, but for my primary use of
        aeropress and pour over it does a really great job.
    </p>
    <h2>Electric Burr Grinder</h2>
    <p>
        I found this electric burr grinder at a second hand shop for a very good deal and it looked nearly unused. It
        uses steel burrs and does a decent job getting a consistent grind. And it can grind a fair bit finer than my
        hand
        grinder. It does have the unfortunate feature of being <em>terribly</em> designed. It's reall loud and it makes
        a big mess.
        It is fairly easy to clean though and much quicker than grinding by hand so i still end up using it more often
        than my hand grinder.
