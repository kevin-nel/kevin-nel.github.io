the first thing I realized when starting with reaper was that I didnt have all the plugins i had before with logic pro and i was hunting down plugins for agesd before I started really being productive. so here are my essential plugins (not included with reaper) for reaper

### Note

this is not a "top free plugins" list as there aree plenty more free plugin sthat are amazoing but i wouldnt consider essential to make reaper a complete DAW.
also if you've purchased better plugins like serum or sylenth1 etc then you may not need all of these.
This is a jumping off point intended to make Reaper a more usable environment for complete beginners or people coming from more production oriented DAWs looking to make electronic music

## Drums

Firstly, unless you want to try figure out reasampleomatic5000 or you make ambient drone music you probably want a nice drum sampler.
For that theres [Sitala](https://decomposer.de/sitala/) an excellent free drum sampler that allows you to drag and drop samples, has multichannel outputs, and gives you the ability to tweak the samples a bit as well.
It also comes with an 808 and a 909 style kit

## Synths

I am going to split this section up between a couple categories, and becuase I come from logic pro I am basically just finding replacements for what I was using in logic.

### "Retro" Synths

If youre like me you probably love a good 80s pad or vintage synth sound and my recommendatiuons are

- [discoDSP OB-XD](https://www.discodsp.com/obxd/) This an emulation of the classic Oberheim DX synthesizer. It is my go to for vintage synth sounds.
- [tal uno 62](https://tal-software.com/products) is a great free emulation of a roland juno. Wile your at it you can just download all the free tal plugins becasue they're all really good.
- [uhe tyrell n6](https://u-he.com/products/tyrelln6/) is an analog style software synth with some cool presets and lots of functionality. The link on their website takes you to a german site, the download links are just a but lower on the page.
- fm synth [dexed](https://asb2m10.github.io/dexed/) is a one to one emulation of the sound processing in the yamaha dx7, it can even read old yamaha dx7 sysex presets. The interface is pretty confusing. If you dont already understand Fm synthesis you can [check out this great video by Andrew Huang for a starter](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvBl3YUBUyY), and [this one by the great cuckoo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJrTk4cgFiQ). The [dead duck ddx10 (download the instruments bundle)](https://www.kvraudio.com/developer/dead-duck-software) could be a viable alternative fo you if your just looking for something simpler. All the dead duck synths are pretty great and simple to understand.

### Bass/Lead (Mono) Synths

- [tal elektro](https://tal-software.com/products) Its a bit of an older one and can be a bit kludgey but its got some nice stock presets.
- [tal noise maker](https://tal-software.com/products) great for grimey basses. TALs filters just sound excellent and dirty.
- [hy mono](https://hy-plugins.com/product/hy-mono/) is my current favorite mono synth vst.

## Modern Synthesizer Plugins

- [helm](https://tytel.org/helm/) is a great open source synth thats nice for more complex and experimental sound design. the modulation options on this one are quite extensive and it reminds me very much of serum.
- [surge](https://surge-synthesizer.github.io/) is another open source plugin with great presets and modulation options, it sounds great and can pull off anything from wavetables and fm to fat analog sounds.

## Real Instruments

spitfire audio has been giving away sample libraries for free every couple of weeks in their [LABS plugin](https://www.spitfireaudio.com/labs).
You really cant go wrong with these they sound very proffesional and its easy to get great sounds out of them.
They are also very responsive to midi velocity and thus can be very expressive.
Also be sure to check their seit eevery couple of weeks as they add more libraries all the time.

- [labs (spitfire audio)](https://www.spitfireaudio.com/labs) is an excellent free plugin whith tons of cinematic and oorchestral instruments as well as pads and other textural sounds.
- organ = [sampleson collab3](https://sampleson.com/collab3-free-tonewheel-organ.html) is an excellent free tonewheel organ reminicnent of the hammond B3.
- Piano = [keyzone classic by bit sonic](https://vstplug-ins.com/keyzoneclassic.html) and LABs soft piano
- epiano = [dead duck Dpiano E](https://www.kvraudio.com/developer/dead-duck-software) and LABS wurlitzer or e-piano
- bass guitar = [ample sounds p bass plugin](https://www.amplesound.net/en/pro-pd.asp?id=19) (bonus: check out their [clouddrum plugin](https://www.amplesound.net/en/pro-pd.asp?id=27))

## Samplers

I have yet to find a sampler that can function similar to abletons for free so when I do need that type of stuff I just use reasampleomatic.
Native Instruements komplete start (kontakt player) can play sampled instruments and the factory selection comes with some really nice sounds but you cant sample your own stuff in the free version.

## FX

### EQ

The stock eq plugin in reaper is great, but if you wnat to step up your EQ game you shoudl try [ReEQ](https://forum.cockos.com/showthread.php?t=213501) (not ReaEQ!). It is a JS plugin but does not come with Reaper you have to copy it into your ``effects`` folder in the Reaper resource path. This eq have quite a few more types of bands as well as Mid/Side processing capabilities which ReaEQ  (the stock EQ plugin) does not have.

### guitars

- [lepou amps](https://www.osirisguitar.com/lepou/). DOnt let the age of these amp modelling plugins fool you. Theyre a classic and for a reason. most of the ampls are a little too high gain for my taste but the hybrit is my favorite amp model. (i think it sound better than the free guitar rig stuff). Just note that these amp sims dont come with any cabinet emulation and the will sound like a box of nails if you dont use a cab sim. but do not fear because thats the next suggestion.
- [nadir for stereo cabs](http://www.igniteamps.com/#software) NadIr is an excellent impulse response plugion that comes with some great free mic and cab impulses. (if you wnat to read up more about impulse responses check out joey sturgis tones' great articles [here (getting started)](https://joeysturgistones.com/blogs/learn/getting-started-with-impulse-responses-for-guitar) and [here (common misconceptions)](https://joeysturgistones.com/blogs/learn/4-things-people-get-wrong-about-impulse-responses))
- [voxengo boogex](https://www.voxengo.com/group/free-vst-plugin-download/) just get al lthe free voxengo plugins theyre great
- [Ignite amps other plugins](http://www.igniteamps.com/#software) Their Ts999 (tubescreamer emulation) and emissary (high gain amp) are also great guitar plugins

### modulation

- hy chorus flanger [just get all the free HY stuff while your at it they're small and sound great](http://www.vst4free.com/index.php?dev=HY-Plugins) (dont worry VST4Free looks kinda old and dodgy but all the downloads are legal, each plugin also has a link to the original developer at the top of the page)
- hy phaser
- [acon digital multiply](https://acondigital.com/products/multiply/). This is an awesome chorus thats really tweakable but still easy to use. I highly recommend this one.
- [pecheneg tremolo](http://pechenegfx.org/plugins/pecheneg-tremolo/), Its a tremolo with a nice interface that makes it very quick to get the tremolo sound you want.
- [pecheneg auto swell](http://pechenegfx.org/plugins/automatic-volume-effect-autoswell-light-in-vst-and-au-formats/), its like a boss slow gear in your daw. no more automating volume swells.
- hy filter (comb filter is cool)

### reverbs

- [tal reverb 4](https://tal-software.com/products/tal-reverb-4), how have you still not downloaded all the free TAL stuff?
- oliriver
- [cloudseed algorithmic reverb](https://github.com/ValdemarOrn/CloudSeed): .the controls are a little weird but it does that beautiful modulated ambeint reverb sound really well.
- [voxeno vintage verb](https://www.voxengo.com/product/oldskoolverb/) for lofi room sounds
- [acon digital reverb solo](https://reverb.com/software/effects/acon-digital/47-reverb-solo) simple and really really good for adding a little bit of natural room/hall into a sound

### delays

- readelay
- hydelay4
- leet delay2 (sonic anomaly)
- [spaceship delay by musical entropy](https://www.musicalentropy.com/SpaceshipDelay.html) my favorite delay VST plugin!, does a great tape emulation and is very lightweight and versatile.

### Stauration and Dynamics

- [klanghelm](https://klanghelm.com/contents/main.php) has 3 great free plugins for some aggressive compression and saturation (IVGI, DC1A, MJUC jr)
- [krush](https://www.tritik.com/products/krush/) awesaome bitcrusher, great on drums
- JS Waveshaping distortion, it comes with reaper and only has one slider but dont unsderestimate it!

## Analysis

[Voxengo SPAN](https://www.voxengo.com/product/span/) is an incredible spectrum analyser that really shouldnt be free. A good spectrum analyser is a powerful tool for mixing and can help help you spot prblems that your equipment might not be letting hear.
Check This amazing video by [Dan Worral explaining how to use a sytem analyzer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZrWMv02tlA). He also has a lot great mixing video for th emore technically inclined.

## Quality of life

### Samples

if you are new then I sugggest just searching for what you need when you need it and download free packs to build up your sample library.
Just be sure not to hoard too many packs and dont be afraid to delete packs you think arent that great.

Check out these great places:

- [goldbaby](https://www.goldbaby.co.nz/freestuff.html)
- [99 sounds](http://99sounds.org/). [Heres a great drum sample pack](http://99sounds.org/drum-samples/) and a pack full of [natural hand claps for you to construct your own clap samples](http://99sounds.org/hands-make-sounds/) but feel free to explore their site they have really nicely curated samples and not much is filler, they also have a piano plugin
- [cymatics](https://cymatics.fm/pages/free-download-vault). if you like EDM then these are for you)
- [bedroomproducersblog](https://bedroomproducersblog.com/free-samples/). This is a great resource over all not just for samples.
- [music radar](https://www.musicradar.com/news/tech/free-music-samples-royalty-free-loops-hits-and-multis-to-download) some are cheesy but there are some gems in these packs

## conclusion

With these FREE plugins you can turn reaper from a great DAW for mixing into a GREAT daw for production as a whole.
