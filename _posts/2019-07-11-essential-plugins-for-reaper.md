The first thing I realized when starting with [Reaper](https://reaper.fm) was that I didn't have all the plugins I had before with logic pro and I was hunting down plugins for ages before I started really being productive. so here are my essential plugins for Reaper.
[TLDR at the end](#conclusion)

### Note

This is not a "top free plugins" list as there are plenty more free plugins that are amazing but I wouldn't consider essential to make reaper a complete DAW.
If you've purchased better plugins like serum or sylenth1 etc, then you may not need all of these.
This is a jumping off point intended to make Reaper a more usable environment for complete beginners or people coming from more production oriented DAWs looking to make electronic music.

<!--
For a list of settings I suggest everyone change when first setting up Reaper, see [my blog post here.]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/music/reaper-settings.html)
-->

## Drums

### Electronic

Firstly, unless you want to try figure out reasampleomatic5000 or you make ambient drone music you probably want a nice drum sampler.
For that theres [Sitala](https://decomposer.de/sitala/) an excellent free drum sampler that allows you to drag and drop samples, has multichannel outputs, gives your midi notes names in reaper, and gives you the ability to tweak the samples with a basic eq, reverse, fades and more!
It also comes with an 808 and a 909 style kit.

### Acoustic

[Steven Slate Drums 5 Sampler](https://stevenslatedrums.com/ssd5/#SSD5FREE) is the highest quality acoustic drum sounds you can get a hold of for free, the free kits it comes with can sound very heavy but the sounds are incredibly recorded and very velocity sensitive. You can tweak each drum sound individually, it supports multichannel outputs and the groove patterns that it comes with are pretty solid too.


## Synths

I am going to split this section up between a couple categories, and because I come from logic pro I am basically just finding replacements for what I was using in logic.

## Modern Synthesizer Plugins

These plugins are going to be your "workhorse" synthesizers.
If you know your stuff you can make any sound using just these 

1. [Surge](https://surge-synthesizer.github.io/) is an open source digital synthesizer with great presets and modulation options, it sounds great and can pull off anything from wavetables and fm to fat analog sounds.
2. [Vital](https://vital.audio/) is an excellent wavetable synthesizer in the vein of Arturia Pygments or Xfer Serum. Not to be over dramatic but this one is a game changer! It basically packs all the features of serum into a free (and open source) plugin. It is made by the same person who made helm which I suggested above. (I have completely switched from serum to Vital since it came out)
  
> Honorable Mention:
>
> [helm](https://tytel.org/helm/) used to be on this list before Vital came out and it is still an excellent plugin.
> it is an open source synth thats nice for more complex and experimental sound design like dubstep or weird glitchy ambience.
> The modulation options are quite extensive and it is extremely versatile.


### "Retro" Synths

If you're like me you probably love a good cheesy 80s pad or warm vintage mono lead synth.
Here are my recommendations.

1. [discoDSP OB-XD](https://www.discodsp.com/obxd/) is an emulation of the classic Oberheim DX synthesizer. It is my go to for vintage polyphonic synth sounds. There are also a lot of preset banks available for it online.
2. [Tal uno 62](https://tal-software.com/products/tal-u-no-62) is a great free emulation of a Roland Juno. 
3. [Uhe tyrell n6](https://u-he.com/products/tyrelln6/) is an analog style software synth with some cool presets and lots of functionality. The link on their website takes you to a german site, the download links are just a but lower on the page.

### FM synths

FM synthesis can be pretty confusing, but if you give it time the sounds achievable can be incredibly rich and complex.

[Dexed](https://asb2m10.github.io/dexed/) is a one to one emulation of the sound processing in the yamaha dx7, it can even read old yamaha dx7 sysex presets. The interface is pretty confusing. 

If you are looking for something a bit easier to use/understand then [Sonic Bits Exakt Lite](https://www.sonicbits.com/exakt-lite.html) is what you are looking for!

The [dead duck ddx10 (download the instruments bundle)](https://www.kvraudio.com/developer/dead-duck-software) could be a viable alternative fo you if your just looking for something dead simple to get you going with some classic fm sounds.

> If you don't already understand FM synthesis you can [check out this great video by Andrew Huang for a starter](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvBl3YUBUyY), and [this one by the excellent cuckoo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJrTk4cgFiQ).


### Bass/Lead (Mono) Synths

What would a list of synthesizers be without some nice mono synths?

1. [Tal elektro](https://tal-software.com/products) Its a bit of an older one and can be a bit kludgey but its got some nice stock presets.
2. [Tal noise maker](https://tal-software.com/products) is another free Tal plugin (see any trends?) it's great for grimey basses, and its interface is much more refined than Tal elektro. Tal's filters just sound excellent and wonderfully dirty.
3. [HY mono](https://hy-plugins.com/product/hy-mono/) This one is my current favorite mono synth vst. It's not too complicated and has just enough to get you fiddling and making some cool sounds.


## Real Instruments

But what if you need an upright bass or trombone or maybe a harp?


Spitfire Audio has been giving away sample libraries for free every couple of weeks in their [LABS plugin](https://www.spitfireaudio.com/labs).
You really can't go wrong with these they sound very professional and it's easy to get great sounds out of them.
They are also very responsive to midi velocity and thus can be very expressive.
Also be sure to check their site every couple of weeks as they add more libraries all the time.

1. [LAB's (Spitfire Audio)](https://www.spitfireaudio.com/labs) has tons of cinematic and orchestral instruments as well as pads and other textural/experimental sounds.
2. [Sampleson collab3](https://sampleson.com/collab3-free-tonewheel-organ.html) is an excellent free tone-wheel organ reminiscent of the hammond B3.
3. [Keyzone Classic by Bit Sonic](https://vstplug-ins.com/keyzoneclassic.html) has a much brighter grand piano type sound as opposed to the soft upright felt piano that comes with LABs. It also has a decent Rhodes-like electric piano.
4. [dead duck Dpiano E](https://www.kvraudio.com/developer/dead-duck-software) has a few different styles of electric piano to choose from if you don't fancy the LABS wurlitzer or e-piano.
5. [Ample Sounds Bass P Lite](https://www.amplesound.net/en/pro-pd.asp?id=19) is a deep sampled P-Bass with plenty of articulations and that classic P-Bass punch. 
6. [Native Instruments Komplete Start](https://www.native-instruments.com/en/products/komplete/bundles/komplete-start/) Has pretty much everything else you could ask for. They're plugins are very high quality and this is just enough of a taste to make you crave the full version of Kontatk but the sounds available are very good.

> bonus: check out Ample Sounds, [Cloud Drum](https://www.amplesound.net/en/pro-pd.asp?id=27), Hang Drum plugin and their [acoustic guitar](https://www.amplesound.net/en/pro-pd.asp?id=7).

## FX

### EQ

The stock eq plugin in reaper is great, but if you want to step up your EQ game you should try [ReEQ](https://forum.cockos.com/showthread.php?t=213501) (not ReaEQ!).
It is a JS plugin, but does not come with Reaper (you have to copy it into your ``effects`` folder in the Reaper resource path).
This EQ has quite a few more types of bands as well as Mid/Side processing capabilities which ReaEQ (the stock EQ plugin) does not have.

### Guitars

- [Lepou amps](https://www.osirisguitar.com/lepou/): Don't let the age of these amp modelling plugins fool you.They're a classic and for a reason. most of the amps are a little too high gain for my taste but the hybrit is my favorite amp model. I even think it sounds better than the free guitar rig stuff).

> Note:
> 
> These amp sims don't come with any cabinet emulation and the **will** sound like a box of nails if you don't use a cab sim, but do not fear because that's the next suggestion.

- [Nadir Cab Sim](http://www.igniteamps.com/#software): An excellent impulse response loader plugin that comes with some great free mic and cab impulses. 
   
> if you want to read up more about impulse responses check out joey sturgis tones' great articles [here (getting started)](https://joeysturgistones.com/blogs/learn/getting-started-with-impulse-responses-for-guitar) and [here (common misconceptions)](https://joeysturgistones.com/blogs/learn/4-things-people-get-wrong-about-impulse-responses)

- [Voxengo Boogex](https://www.voxengo.com/group/free-vst-plugin-download/): It can sound a little boxy but it gives you decent control over teh sound with a graphical eq and some decent cab impulses.

- [Ignite Amps other plugins](http://www.igniteamps.com/#software): Their Ts999 (tubescreamer emulation) and emissary (high gain amp) are also great guitar plugins.

### Modulation

- [Acon Digital multiply](https://acondigital.com/products/multiply/): This is an awesome chorus thats really tweakable but still easy to use. I highly recommend this one. It's especially good for more subtle chorus sounds or adding some width.
- [HY chorus-flanger](http://www.vst4free.com/index.php?dev=HY-Plugins): An excellent chorus that has a more intense boss ce-3 type sound.

> don't worry! although plugins4free does looks kind of dodgy, all the downloads are legal, and each plugin has a link to the original developer at the top of the page

- HY filter: The comb filter and vowel filter are particularly cool.
- HY phaser: A decent phaser made by the same person. (Just get all the free HY stuff while your at it. They're small and sound great!)
- [Pecheneg tremolo](http://pechenegfx.org/plugins/pecheneg-tremolo/): It's a tremolo with a nice interface that makes it very quick to get the tremolo sound you want.
- [Pecheneg auto swell](http://pechenegfx.org/plugins/automatic-volume-effect-autoswell-light-in-vst-and-au-formats/): Like a boss slow gear in your DAW. No more automating volume swells!


### Reverbs

Unfortunately when it comes to reverbs the free options are not quite as good as paid ones, I suggest your first plugin be a good reverb like Native Instruments Raum, or Valhalla Room. 
There are also plenty of reverb impulse responses available online that you can load into Reaverb. [Waves even has some](https://www.waves.com/downloads/ir-convolution-reverb-library)
You can also wait for giveaways which most plugin companies do fairly often.

- [Tal reverb 4](https://tal-software.com/products/tal-reverb-4) is an early 2000s styled digital plate reverb, you can get some crazy ambiance out of it, but don't expect anything realistic.
- [Oliriver plate/hall reverb](https://www.kvraudio.com/product/orilriver-by-denis-tihanov) is a more subdued hall/plate style reverb that can get the more realistic and subtle sounds down.
- [Cloudseed algorithmic reverb](https://github.com/ValdemarOrn/CloudSeed), the controls are a little weird but it does that beautiful modulated ambient reverb sound **really** well.
- [Voxeno vintage verb](https://www.voxengo.com/product/oldskoolverb/) for lofi room sounds.
- [Acon digital reverb solo](https://reverb.com/software/effects/acon-digital/47-reverb-solo) simple and good for adding a little bit of natural room/hall into a sound
- [Valhalla supermassive](https://valhalladsp.com/shop/reverb/valhalla-supermassive/) is another ambient reverb/delay with a funky control scheme brought to you by the team responsible for some of the best modern reverb sounds. 

### Delays

- Readelay, the stock delay plugin in Reaper, has a few quirks but you can get a lot of decent sounds out of it. You can check out [this video by Dan Worrall](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5UmNyk6vNA8) explaining it in more depth.
- Leet Delay2 by Sonic Anomaly can be downloaded through [reapack](https://reapack.com/) or [on reverb.com](https://reverb.com/software/effects/sonic-anomaly/407-sonic-anomaly-leet-delay-2), it' a really nice dark gritty analog style delay.
- [Spaceship Delay by Musical Entropy](https://www.musicalentropy.com/SpaceshipDelay.html) my favorite delay VST plugin! It does everything from pristine digital delay to gritty tape emulation with flutter and modulation. It is also very lightweight and versatile.

### Saturation and Dynamics

- [Klanghelm](https://klanghelm.com/contents/main.php) has 3 great free plugins for some aggressive compression and saturation (IVGI, DC1A, MJUC jr)
- [Krush](https://www.tritik.com/products/krush/) is an awesome bit-crusher and distortion, really great on drums.
- The JS Waveshaping distortion comes with Reaper and only has one slider but don't underestimate it!
- [FreeClip by Venn Audio](https://www.vennaudio.com/free-clip/) similar to JS waveshaping distortion but with a few more saturation curves. It doesn't have any eq but it's a very versatile saturation and clipping plugin that can do everything from hard digital clipping to flubby tube style overdrive.

## Analysis

[Voxengo SPAN](https://www.voxengo.com/product/span/) is an incredible spectrum analyser that really shouldn't be free. A good spectrum analyser is a powerful tool for mixing and can help help you spot problems that your equipment might not be letting hear.
Check This amazing video by [Dan Worral explaining how to use a spectrum analyzer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZrWMv02tlA). He also has a lot great mixing videos for the more technically inclined.

## Quality of life

### Samples

If you are new then I suggest just searching for what you need when you need it and download free packs to build up your sample library.
Just be sure not to hoard too many packs and don't be afraid to delete packs you think aren't that great.

Check out these great places:

- [goldbaby](https://www.goldbaby.co.nz/freestuff.html)
- [99 sounds](http://99sounds.org/), [has a great drum sample pack](http://99sounds.org/drum-samples/) and a pack full of [natural hand claps](http://99sounds.org/hands-make-sounds/) for you to construct your own clap samples with, but feel free to explore their site. They have really nicely curated samples and not much is filler.
- [Cymatics](https://cymatics.fm/pages/free-download-vault). If you like EDM then these are for you.
- [Bedroom Producers Blog](https://bedroomproducersblog.com/free-samples/): This is a great resource over all not just for samples. They post often about plugin giveaways and other production news and are not spammy at all. I highly recommend signing up for their newsletter.
- [MusicRadar](https://www.musicradar.com/news/tech/free-music-samples-royalty-free-loops-hits-and-multis-to-download) some of them are cheesy but there are some gems in these packs.
