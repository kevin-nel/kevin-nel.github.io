Ever since [Matt Tytel's Vital](https://vital.audio/) released late 2020 I've been playing with this synth almost non stop. It's an amazing wavetable synth in the vein of [Xfer serum](https://xferrecords.com/products/serum/) and [Arturia Pigments](https://www.arturia.com/store/analog-classics/pigments) but **it's entirely free** (although you can opt to pay for more stock patches to be included and support the developer if you'd like).

Since I've been pumping out presets for this synth I thought I would make my presets available to download for free.

You can get them [here]() as either individual presets or a bank containing all of them.

I'll keep them updated as I tweak and make more so be sure to save/rename any that you like if you ever plan on re-downloading them again (just incase they get overwritten if I change them).
