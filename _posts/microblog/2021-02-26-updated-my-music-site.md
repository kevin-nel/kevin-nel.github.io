i finally bought a domain name for my music website.
halfdeep.com was unfortunately taken so i got the next best thing [halfdeep.xyz](https://halfdeep.xyz).
i kind of like .xyz domains though so not all too bad.
i also have my music available for [purchase through bandcamp](https://halfdeep.bandcamp.com/album/lunar) now.
