at first i thought this game looked bad and overly complicated, but decided to give it a try.
man, am i hooked!
clocked in over 30 hours in my first week with only 2 colonies.
i'm having quite a lot of fun, especially considering that i haven't really been able to enjoy video games/movies/music in a while.
it's complicated but you pick it all up quite naturally as you go along and i haven't yet felt overwhelmed
the experience reminds me very much of being glued to the glowing crt playing age of empires as a kid.
