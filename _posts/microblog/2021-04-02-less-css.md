I've been doing quite a bit of maintenance on the site.
Adding ``h-card`` and ``h-entry`` tags to the html for indieweb support and overall simplifying the html code generated by jekyll.

The site now uses only 43 lines of css and still has dark/light modes and uses 3 different fonts.
The css for the site had grown to over 200 lines and it sill looked pretty basic so I scrapped it and simplified it.
The goal was to get the site to look 80% the same with 20% of the css (200*20% = 40).

Next steps will be to get webmentions working so that I have a form of interaction/comments on the site.
