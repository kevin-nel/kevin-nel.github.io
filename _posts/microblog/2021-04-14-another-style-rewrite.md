title: "yet another style re write"

so as cool as it was to have a ``m i n i m a l i s t`` stylesheet, it's kinda boring.
so i decided to make the site a little more "websitey" with the nav on the side and a cool background, and the mobile version of the site just makes it look the same as before using a media query.
the simplicity of not relying on media queries and just using ``max-width`` was nice but i could'nt get it to be responsive using flexbox.

there's also a footer now.
