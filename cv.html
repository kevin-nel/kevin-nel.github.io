			I'm an electronic engineering student with a knack for all things tech and a love for creating
			cool stuff. My days are filled with learning new things, and I'm always on the lookout for
			exciting challenges.

			When I'm not buried in my studies, you'll find me jamming on my guitar, producing my own music,
			and getting lost in the world of sound. But that's not all, I also enjoy the hands-on thrill of
			building mechanical keyboards and bringing my wild ideas to life with 3D printing.

			My approach to problem-solving is simple yet effective: find the most straightforward and
			easy-to-understand solution. As Albert Einstein wisely said, "If you can't explain it simply,
			you don't understand it well enough." So, I'm always on a mission to demystify complexity and
			make things more accessible.

			If you're looking for someone who can blend software and embedded engineering seamlessly, I'm
			your person!
