      <p>
        I pride myself on constant learning and having a broad knowledge.
        Being creative is an important part of my ability to think critically and find out of the box solutions to
        problems.
      </p>

      <p>
        I strive to come up with the simplest and easiest to understand solutions and always keep the following quote to
        mind.
      <blockquote>
        "If you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it well enough." ~ Albert Einstein
      </blockquote>
      </p>

      <p>
        When I'm not busy with my studies I enjoy spending my free time working on personal projects, producing music,
        and
        playing guitar.

              The School of leadership is a youth leadership development initiative that is unique to Sutherland High
              School.
              It removes pupils from their comfort zones and uses hardship and sacrifice to prepare the participants for
              the hardships that leaders often undergo.
              Pupils are given the opportunity to take part in a series of programs and activities that are specifically
              aimed at developing their leadership ability and personal growth.
              The skills that learners gain from such a course is not only aimed to develop the "school" learner but to
              provide the skills that they can use and keep for the rest of their lives.
