until recently i have been storing information like links and pdfs and random notes and such all over the place on my computer without much thought or care.
but recently i watched a video about personal knowledge management systems that had a bit of a shift in my thinking.
the biggest change was that brains are for having ideas not for storing them and thus it becomes important to have a system for linking all the existing knowledge you have so that your brain can spend more time having ideas and less time stressing about having to remember things.
i'm still not sure how i will implement this "second brain" but it's going to take some work.
i may have to write a longer post on this.
