add links (eff "I have nothing to hide", spotify new patent, facebook manipulation, whatsapp privacy policy etc.)
better introduction

My last attempt at documenting my exploration into online privacy awareness was to be frank quite bad.
At best it was a crude summary.
Since then (2018) I have learned a lot and cracked down on data collection by big corporations even further.

This article will address three main areas

1. Why should you care if you have nothing to hide?
2. What are some **easy** things you can do and simple habit changes that can help.
3. The next steps that I have taken since my last article (This will cover some more advanced things and stuff that may be a bit difficult to do if you are comfortable with the conveniences of the modern web)

## Why Should You Care?

1. not about having anything to hide its about being able to choose who you want to share things with
    - for example, ...
1. big tech has the power to not only manipulate you personally but manipulate the entire world.
    - companies like facebook, google, and amazon make money off of advertising and the private information they collect on you gives then the ability to not only run a successful advertising campaign but to guarantee more business for the companies paying them to advertise. They are able to manipulate and shape information on a per person basis in order to get you to click on a link or even change your opinion on topics.
1. It is selfish to not care.
    - you don't realise how much information about your friends and other contacts you are giving away when you are careless.
    - does that mobile game really need access to your contacts, calendar and phone logs?

## Some Easy First Steps

### Switching To Software That Respects Your Privacy By Default

google or bing search engine -> duckduckgo

- no filter bubble
- instant answers and reliable websites are the first suggestions not sponsored posts
- no tracking
- built in dark mode!
  
google password remembering features -> bitwarden (multidevice cloud sync) or keepass (offline)

whatsapp or fb messenger -> signal

spotify -> apple music

chrome -> firefox (or bromite on mobile)

- use an adblocker (ublock origin)
- block 3rd party cookies

## Fixing Bad Habits

### Don'T Stay Logged In All The Time

another easy fix is to not stay logged in for months on end.
This is especially easy to do on mobile where apps make it very easy to forget about.
log out of apps after using them and clear your browsers cookies, site data and history (ctrl shift delete for most browsers) after each browser session and before doing things like shopping.

### Disable Your Location On Mobile

... (nearby device scanning, etc)

### Dont Let Apps Run In The Background Unless You Need Them To

in newer versions of android (ver 8 and up) you can prevent an app from running in the background by
...

### Be Careful Of The Permissions You Grant To Apps And Websites

if an app does not obviously need a hardware feature like the camera or location, don't grant it access to it.

### Tweaking Your Privacy Options

Almost all sites and online services that use an account allow you to tweak your privacy settings.
Google allows very fine control over your account and even lets you disable targetted advertising and reset your advertising ID (a unique identifier that allows google to combine multiple sources of information on you to map your interests).
beyond that you should disable any features you don't absolutely need (for example location data).

>It's important to check these settings every once in a while as new features can be added or old settings can be reset.
