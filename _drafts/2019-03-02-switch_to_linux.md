## breakdown

1. reason : mac was unbearbly slow (after I replaced the hdd with an ssd)
1. partition was a mission
2. tried manjaro open box
	- had too many duplicate programs and wasnt as minimal as I thought
	- was extremely fast though
	- lots of small things needed to be configured for my 2012 macbook pro 13"
3. installed linux mint xfce
	- first thoughts were that it looked 95% like cinnamon (the customization already done was great and the mint-y themes are great)
	- downloaded plank and moved the panel to the top
	- after a couple hours of use I (by instinct) pressed the keyboard backlight button and man was I surprised, it all worked
	- it did get very hot though and I hadn't notice the fans kick in, so after a bit of research I added ``macfanctrld`` to my startup programs and it was all perfect.
4. window managers
	- xfwm4 was good enough for most stuff although I was using a tiling wm on osx (amethyst) and was missing the nice autoplacement of windows. I began to look for tiling functions in the window manager settings and that was when I discovered compiz
	- compiz is animation heaven and I was able to experience all the fancy smooth animations once again ( I had disabled all animations in OSX to try speed up the system)
	- wobbly windows
	- but I was missing the speediness of manjaro openbox,
	- so I tried xfce with open box but struggled geting a theme to match my mint-y-dark-grey setup

conclusion:

1. linux has made using my macbook fun again and I no longer have to compromise because of speed, and most of my config files (for neovim and calcurse) worked out of the box

## phase 2

1. I switched tro fedora for a linux challenge and itwas quite interesting
2. very minimal install with NO propreitary stuff
3. including my wifi driver so I had to find an ethernet cable and get my wifi working
4. after that fedora was perfect, the fans kicked in, keyboard brightness worked and there are touchpad gestures by default awesome!
5. gnome was a bit sluggish on my old macbook though so I decided to go back try plasma but it was too complicated for me 
6. I then tried xfce again and it was great but again I was missing my window tiling
7. I had slowsly started to use more and more terminal applications in place of GUI stuff (largely becasue of performance but also because the stuff interested me)
8. I figured out hopw to get bspwm working inside xfce (this was great because I didnt have to fiddle wit setting up a panel and xfce ahs really nice power management out of the box.)
9. I then discovered the program Oomox and went crazy making my own themes and ricing my setup 9largely inspired by r/unixporn
10. all was not sunshine and roses though, there were a few programs I needed for university that didnt work and I was forced to use the abysmally slow lab PCs (i study electronic engineering)
11. then one of my classmates was also talking about linux and he said he did get it to work in pop!_os
12. I then went and install pop!_os and everything just worked and all the small stuff made so much sense that I didnt even feel like customizing or changing anything
13. gnome is also way more responsive on pop than on fedora and I hardly ever feel like im waiting for things to happen

## phase 3

1. unfortunately my harddrive died
2. but I plan to replace it with an ssd in the holidays and try out a couple more distros in the holiday mainly elementary, vamilla ubuntu, manjaro, solus and possibly something more challengin like arch (which I most probably won't use next year for studies)

## phase 4

1. unfortunately I still run windows 10 on my gaming pc at home because games are just less of a hassle to gety up and running on windows and I also really enjoy music production and have speent hundreds of hours learning reaper (after switching from logic pro on OSX which I had poured evne more hours into) and haven been able to get the linux version working as smoothly with vsts. maybe if they add a windows vst bridge (similar to the way reaper handles 32bit plugins) to make it more hassle free and I can figure out how to get my audio interfae working withough fiddling with pulse audio and jack.
2. main pont is that I enjoy fiddling with my computer but when I am making music I like there to be less in the way and having to fiddle with computer stuff definitely take me out of *the zone*
