here you can select what layer you'd like the graphics to appear on.
The silk screen is the print that would usually indicate component numbers and other information
You could also put the graphic on the soldermask layer (F. Mask/B. Mask).
This would leave out the solder mask in those areas (like a solder pad) leaving a shiny finish.
If you decide to do it on the solder mask layer then you need to be careful of overlapping with existing solder pads as you could cause a short and render your board useless.

You will need to play with the scale to get it to fit.
If you want to place things at angles it can be usefull to change kicads rotation setting to allow 45 degree or smaller angles.
You can then use `R` to rotate your graphics.

for this circuit board I wanted to have graphics on both sides so that they could be used for either half of the keyboard.
I made the following graphics in inkscape, starting with the provided svg cutout files for the corne case.

The gerber files used for production can be generated by installing the "Fabrication Toolkit" plugin (it should be available in the plugin manager by default in KiCAD 7+)

here is a render from kicad of what the pcb should look like

I then ordered the PCBS through JLCPCB and waited about 2 weeks
