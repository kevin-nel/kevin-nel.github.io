i am looking into getting a 3d printer.
probably the ender 3 since its quite popular and i can find a lot of community mods/upgrades and support for it.
i love acquiring new skills and as an engineering student i think that getting familiar with cad and manufacturing could be a useful skillset to pick up.
it also seems like a great way to give more life to things i might usually throw away by 3d printing replacement parts.
i also like the fact that additive manufacturing like fdm printing produces much less waste than subtractive manufacturing like milling.
