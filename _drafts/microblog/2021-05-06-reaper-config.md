title: "minimal reaper config and setting up music production on linux"

After discovering [``yabridge``](https://github.com/robbert-vdh/yabridge) and seeing [The Reaper Blog's video on setting up reaper from scratch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u5GU3mwJf2E), I decided I would try and set up my linux machine (running fedora) for music production with Reaper.
To my surprise it was only slightly more work than doing it on Windows.
Most of the problems I ran into were the result of me using fedora and not a debian based distribution.
Even the windows VSTs installed with wine and running through ``yabridge`` work great!
after I was done adding my toolbar buttons and changing preferences I decided to export my ``.reaperConfigZip`` and post it [here](/assets/other/Base.ReaperConfigZip).
I may write a longer blog post about setting it up or make a Youtube video but for now you can get my reaper settings [here](/assets/other/Base.ReaperConfigZip).
