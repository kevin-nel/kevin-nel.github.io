after searching far and wide for a mastodon instance to call my home, i found [merveilles.town](https://merveilles.town).
"[merveilles](https://merveilles.town) is a community project aimed at the establishment of new ways of speaking, seeing and organizing information â€” a culture that seeks augmentation through the arts of engineering and design."

i will be posting there semi regularly as an augmentation to this website.
you can find me at [@kevin@merveilles.town](https://merveilles.town/@kevin).
there is now also a link to my mastodon profile in the footer of the website.
