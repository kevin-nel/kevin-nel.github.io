now that my personal site has a more stable stylesheet and vibe i am going to do a little more work on my music site [halfdeep.xyz](https://halfdeep.xyz).
i haven't updated it since my last release in february and i think it can be tidied up quite a bit.
i would like to have separate pages for each section instead of just the headings and i want to make it more obvious where people can find my music and get hold of me.

p.s. i promise i will write less about making my website nice and i will actually write blog posts again soon.
i have "part 2 of my degoogling" as well as an article about the fediverse in the works.
