i am busy exploring the fediverse to see what it's all about.
there's a pretty equal mix of cool stuff and really atrocious stuff.
since its up to the instance admins to moderate and filter stuff it's actually pretty important where you sign up.
you also can't be afraid to just block absolutely anyone.
maybe ill compile a list of fediverse instances that are better moderated.
