title: "the end of the microblog"

I have been using my mastodon account in pretty much the same way that I envisioned this microblog being used.
The convenience of a social platform for this kind of short "off the cuff" post beats a website update by a huge margin for me and that is why I haven't been using it much.
I have really been enjoying the interactions I've had on [merveilles.town](https://merveilles.town) and found a little pocket of the internet that feels fresh, helpful and inspiring to me.

This is then the end of the microblog (for now at least).
