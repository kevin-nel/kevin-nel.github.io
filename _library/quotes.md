> "Computer Science is no more about computers than astronomy is about telescopes." ~ E. W. Dijkstra

> "I think it is ok for authors (please let's not call them creators, they are not gods) to ask for money for copies of their works (please let's not devalue these works by calling them content) in order to gain income (the term compensation falsely implies it is a matter of making up for some kind of damages)" ~ Richard Stallman

> "The fastest way to burn out is thinking you'll solve all your problems by doing more." ~ Matt D'Avella

> "Creativity is just connecting things. When you ask creative people how they did something, they feel a little guilty because they didn't really do it, they just saw something. It seemed obvious to them after a while. That's because they were able to connect experiences they've had and synthesize new things." ~ Steve Jobs

> "People who say they never got a chance never took one." ~ Unknown

> "Strange, isn't it? Here we are in the darkest corner of this earth, and we're afraid of our own kind." ~ The Bad Batch 2016

> "I've never believed that they're separate. Leonardo da Vinci was a great artist and a great scientist. Michelangelo knew a tremendous amount about how to cut stone at the quarry. The finest dozen computer scientists I know are all musicians. Some are better than others, but they all consider that an important part of their life. I don't believe that the best people in any of these fields see themselves as one branch of a forked tree. I just don't see that.People bring these things together a lot. Dr. Land at Polaroid said, "I want Polaroid to stand at the intersection of art and science," and I've never forgotten that. I think that that's possible, and I think a lot of people have tried." ~ Steve Jobs

> "Every child is an artist, the problem is staying an artist when you grow up" ~ Pablo Picasso

> "Technology only adds more—it is never this or that; it is always this and that. A quick example from my life: Twitter didn’t replace Facebook. The iPad didn’t replace my phone. My phone didn’t replace my TV. Now, I watch YouTube on my iPad, toss the video up to my TV, while checking Twitter and Facebook on my phone. It’s a little constellation of technology. But I keep asking myself: how many more things can I juggle? And for how long?" ~ Frank Chimero (the webs grain)

> "Brains are for having ideas, not storing them" ~ Unknown
