	Hi, I'm Kevin. I am an electronic engineering student currently living in sunny South Africa. I enjoy good
	coffee and love to make music and build stuff.
</p>
<p>
	I enjoy playing guitar, experimenting with synthesizers and producing music.
</p>
<p>
	Computers fascinate me and I enjoy learning about the different ways that computers have been used historically,
	how
	their purpose has changed in everyday life, and exploring alternative ways their roles can be filled.
