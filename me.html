		Hi, I'm Kevin. I am an electronic engineering student currently living in sunny South Africa. I enjoy
		good coffee and love to make music and build stuff.
	</p>
	<p>
		I enjoy playing guitar, experimenting with synthesizers and producing music.
	</p>
	<p>
		Computers fascinate me and I enjoy learning about the different ways that computers have been used
		historically, how their purpose has changed in everyday life, and exploring alternative ways
		their roles can be filled.
