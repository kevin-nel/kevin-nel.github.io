    Hi, I'm Kevin Nel am an electronic engineering student currently living in sunny South Africa I enjoy good coffee
    and love to make music and build stuff.

<p>
    I enjoy playing guitar, experimenting with synthesizers and producing music.

<p>
    Computers fascinate me and I enjoy learning about the different ways that computers have been used historically, how
    their purpose has changed in everyday life, and exploring alternative ways their roles can be filled.
