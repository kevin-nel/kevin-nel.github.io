## Desktop PC

- ryzen 5 2600 six core (12 thread) processor
- nvidia gtx1060 3gb
- msi b350m mortar micro atx motherboard
- antex 500w psu
- 1Tb nvme ssd
- 240gb sata ssd
- 500gb sata 7200rpm hdd
- 1tb external 5400rpm hdd
- corsair 275r case

## Macbook Pro

I have been using this machine since 2015

It was my first computer. I used it to start learning music production. I used it for university and when MacOS wasn't working any more I put Linux on it and I still use it to this day (although not as my main laptop).

- The keyboard is great.
- It has almost all the ports I need (just missing an hdmi)
- It's easily repairable.
- I still get a good 4-6 hours of battery life out of it
- And it's still good enough to use almost 10 years later (in 2021)

### Upgrades

I have since replaced the Hard disk with a 120Gb SSD and upgraded the ram from 4Gb to 6Gb.
It may not seem like much but those two upgrades alone turn this computer from frustration to a perfectly usable machine.
It's no where near as powerful as my desktop [pc](pc.md), but it's more than enough to get some work done and browse the web and its extremely portable.
