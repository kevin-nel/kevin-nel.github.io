title: 2012 macbook pro

I have been using this machine since 2015

It was my first computer
I used it to start learning music production
I used it for university
When MacOS wasn't working any more I put [Linux](/knowledge/linux.md) on it and I still use it to this day.

- The keyboard is great.
- It has almost all the ports I need (just missing an hdmi)
- It's easily repairable.
- I still get a good 4-6 hours of battery life out of it
- And it's still good enough to use almost 10 years later (in 2021)

## Upgrades

I have since replaced the Hard disk with a 120Gb SSD and upgraded the ram from 4Gb to 6Gb.
It may not seem like much but those two upgrades alone turn this computer from frustration to a perfectly usable machine.
It's no where near as powerful as my desktop [pc](pc.md), but it's more than enough to get some work done and browse the web and its extremely portable.
