      Hi, I'm <a class="u-url u-uid" href="https://kevinnel.com"><span class="p-name">Kevin</span></a>
      <br>
      I am an electronic engineering student currently living in sunny <span class="p-locality">South Africa</span>,
      I enjoy good coffee and love to make <a class="p-category" href="https://halfdeep.xyz">music</a>.
      I write about <span class="p-category">music</span>, <span class="p-category">tech</span>, and my <span class="p-category">electronics</span> projects.
    </p>
    <p>
      My online presence has been quite ephemeral the last couple years, but in recent months I have taken to cultivating my own website and trying to make my use of the internet more productive.
      My goal is to tip the scale and have my time spent creating be more than my time spent consuming and to overall become a more prolific human being.
      I tend towards being somewhat of a generalist or "jack of all trades" in my endevours and pride myself on learning and having a broad knowledge.
    </p>
    <p>
      I also love making new and interesting sounds using synthesizers and digital audio workstations, and fancy myself to be a pretty good cook.
      Vintage and "retro" computing fascinates me and I enjoy learning about how computers have been used historically and how their purpose has changed in everyday life. (The cool noises they make is just a bonus for me)
