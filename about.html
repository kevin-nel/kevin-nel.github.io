        <p>Hi, I'm <span class="p-name">{{site.author}}</span>
            am an electronic engineering student currently living in sunny
            <span class="p-country-name">South Africa</span>
            I enjoy good <a href="/gear/coffee/">coffee</a> and love to make <a
                href="http://halfdeep.bandcamp.com">music</a>
            and <a href="/projects/projects.md">build stuff</a>.
        </p>

        <p>
            I enjoy playing guitar, experimenting with synthesizers and producing music.
        </p>

            Computers fascinate me and I enjoy learning about the different ways that computers have been used
            historically,
            how their purpose has changed in everyday life, and exploring alternative ways their roles can be
            filled.
        </p>
