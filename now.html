	<p>
		Right <a href="https://nownownow.com/about">now</a> I am working as an electronic engineer at SevenLabsTechnology.
		I am enjoying the variety of work that I get to do.
		A bit of circuit design, pcb layout, embedded development in c++, and even a bit of networking stuff for IoT.
		I am enjoying it way more than studying.
		Additionally I'm trying to get a bit more active and doing some park runs (weekly 5k).
		<!--
		I will be graduating with my electronic engineering
		degree in the next couple of months and I am looking forward to entering the working world and
		all the new things that come with starting a new chapter like this.
