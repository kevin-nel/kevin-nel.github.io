<p>
    Right <a href="https://nownownow.com/about">now</a> I am busy with my final year of electronic engineering busy with
    final year project and digital signal processing.
    My final year project is to design a digital guitar amplifier model that runs on an embedded platform.
    There's a lot of new stuff to learn and I'm excited to see what I can do.
    The reason I first was interested in electronics was guitar pedals so this is really exciting for me!
    University is taking most of my time up this year but I am still trying to keep some balance by keeping active,
    doing
    park runs (5 km every Saturday morning), and taking time to play some guitar when I can.
